# Asthitwa 
Asthitwa offers advanced voice replication to mimic specific voices accurately, ensuring natural, comforting interactions. It excels in emotional support with pre-programmed messages and personalized NLP responses. Users can customize by uploading voice samples. Privacy and security are prioritized with secure storage and data control.

Requirements

1. *Voice Capture*:
   - Implement a function to record voice samples from the user. Ensure the recording is of high quality and sufficient length to capture the nuances of the user's voice.

2. *Voice Model Training*:
   - Use a machine learning framework (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to train a voice synthesis model on the captured voice samples. Consider using existing voice synthesis architectures like Tacotron or WaveNet.

3. *User Confirmation*:
   - Once the initial model is trained, synthesize a sample voice clip using the model. Present this clip to the user for confirmation.
   - If the user approves, proceed to save the model. If not, adjust the training parameters or request more voice samples and retrain.

4. *Model Saving*:
   - Save the trained model securely, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access it.

5. *Voice Output*:
   - Integrate the trained model into the voice assistant system. Ensure that the assistant uses the trained voice model to respond to user queries.

6. *User Interface*:
   - Develop a simple user interface that allows the user to record their voice, provide feedback on the synthesized voice, and interact with the voice assistant.

7. *Security and Privacy*:
   - Ensure that all voice data and user interactions are handled securely. Implement appropriate data protection and privacy measures.
